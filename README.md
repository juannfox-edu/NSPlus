# XNSDiagrams

A JS powered Nassi-Shneiderman diagrams renderer application. This is a *fork* of [Charly Cimino's XNSDiagrams](https://github.com/CharlyCimino/XNSDiagrams), developed by the students of ORT institute, Argentina.

## Implementation

This project is completely developed in JavaScript and CSS, rendering HTML on the fly from a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) structure.
In addition, it can create an image from the rendered diagram.

## Next steps

The next step will be to create a drag-and-drop diagram editor that helps people learn (and teach) programming algorithms by using an online tool, in an agile and comfortable way and without using paper and pencil.

## USE IT
